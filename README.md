# Flight-Reservation

A very rudimentary project of a webapp for the management of seat reservation on a flight of a hypothetical company.The focus of the project was to use the concepts of concurrency while maintaining the consistency of the information both in the database and in the display of data on screen thanks to the use of transactions, in case two or more users were booking seats at the same time.

Technologies used: PHP, JavaScript (JQuery), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.
